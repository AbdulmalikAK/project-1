In this project I answer some question about DVD rental , and through answering them , I learn how to deal with sql elements , 
how to write a query , using JOIN , AGGREGATION , MIN , MAX and so on .


-- HERE IS SOME EXAMPLES OF THE QUERIES --

#What is the rental duration for the category id >= 15 and their max rate?

select distinct rental_duration  ,
max( rental_rate) over (order by release_year ) as Max_rate
from film 
join film_category 
on film.film_id = film_category.film_id 
where category_id  >= 15 ;
                                                                                  
                         

---------------------------------------------

#What is the lowest film rate that his title starts with A ?


SELECT min(rental_rate) as lowest_film_rate
FROM film                                                            
WHERE film_id IN                                               
(SELECT c.film_id                                                 
 from film f join film_category c                       
 on c.film_id = f.film_id                                      
 WHERE film.title like 'A%' ) ;
